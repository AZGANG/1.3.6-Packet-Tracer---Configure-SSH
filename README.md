# 1.3.6 Packet Tracer - Configure SSH
Objectives
Part 1: Secure Passwords

Part 2: Encrypt Communications

Part 3: Verify SSH Implementation

Background
SSH should replace Telnet for management connections. Telnet uses insecure plain text communications. SSH provides security for remote connections by providing strong encryption of all transmitted data between devices. In this activity, you will secure a remote switch with password encryption and SSH.
